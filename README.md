by Eddie Nijholt, Nandor Sieben, and James W. Swift.

To download the files, use the green Code button and save the zip file to your hard drive.  Then unzip.

You need access to the Mathematica program to run the notebooks (foo.nb) but you can see the code and the output at foo.pdf.

The two "Sequences*.nb" notebooks each make a version of Figure 6 with nMax = 20, using two different methods.  The paper uses nMax = 8.  You can run with larger values of nMax.
